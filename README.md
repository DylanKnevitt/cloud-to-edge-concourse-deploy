# cloud-to-edge-concourse-deploy

This project is a set of customizations on top of the base project
[vmware-pks-deploy](https://github.com/vmware/vmware-pks-deploy), which actually
provides a general purpose Concourse installation and deployment framework.  
These files are composed with the base framework to create a tool to deploy the
Cloud-to-Edge components in a scalable and user friendly way.

## Overview

This repo should not be checked out directly, but instead pulled down by Google
Repo as described in the base repository,
[Cloud-To-Edge Builder](https://github.com/vmware/cloud-to-edge).

Follow the steps in that README to deploy a machine, install Concourse on it,
and load in a pipeline to build a custom Edge/IoT deployment.
